# NAS Algorithms evaluated in NAS-Bench-201

The Python files in this folder are used to re-produce the results in our NAS-Bench-201 paper.

We have upgraded the codes to be more general and extendable at [NATS-algos](https://github.com/D-X-Y/AutoDL-Projects/tree/main/exps/NATS-algos).

**Notice** On 24 May 2021, the codes in `AutoDL` repo have been re-organized. If you find `module not found` error, please let me know. I will fix them ASAP.
